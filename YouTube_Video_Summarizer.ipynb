      " In this video, I'll show you how to build your own artificial intelligence application that utilizes RAG, Retrieval Augmented Generation, without writing a single line of code, and in just a few minutes. Now the way we'll do that is using something called Langflow. Now I have it open on my screen, you can see what the finished application will look like, and notice that it's all visual. We can pull in here some pre-built components, we can connect them in a really intuitive way, and then we can run the entire application right from this platform. So let me run it for you, give you a quick demo, and then I'll show you exactly how we build this. So the demo is running, and just to give you a bit of information, this app is going to represent a chatbot for something like a restaurant. Now really it could work in any context, but the idea is we'll have something like a PDF here that has some commonly answered questions. So if you're a restaurant or some store, you probably get asked the same thing all the time, when are you open, where are you located, do you accept credit cards, cash, whatever, so that's inside of some PDF document. We're going to pass that to the LLM, and then the LLM will be able to answer questions based on that document, and it's also going to store our conversation history, so we'll remember what we asked last. So let's ask it a question, and notice that I can even put in my name here, so that we can see who's answering or sorry, who's asking the question. So we'll say, what time are you open, and do I need a reservation question mark? Let's see what it says, even though I spelled that incorrectly. So there you go, we got a response, we're open from 11am to 10pm, blah blah blah, and while reservations are recommended, we always try to accommodate walk-ins. Let's ask it something else, let's say, can you tell me about the specials and the menu question mark? And there we are, we have a reply here that's giving us some information from the PDF, so variety of vegetarian and vegan dishes, they have a kids menu, and there's specials based on the chef's selection. If I go back to the PDF, you can see that if we look here at our specials, for example, it says yes, we feature specials that include dishes and chef's selection, do you have a children's menu? Yes, we have a children's menu, do you accommodate food options, etc. It kind of gave us all of those different responses, and combined them together. So I know it seems simple, but this is something you could really extend and make quite cool. So let's have a look now at how we build this. Okay, so to get started here, we are going to need to install Langflow, don't worry, it's free, it runs locally on our computer, we can actually install it using PIP, so long as we have Python version 3.10 or above. Now, once we do that, we're actually going to create a vector store database using something called AstroDB from the company DataStacks. Now, DataStacks is actually the sponsor of this video, don't worry, they're free, you don't need to pay for them, and they've actually teamed up with Langflow just to make this that much better. Once we do that, we're then going to use OpenAI, so we're going to create an OpenAI API key, and we're going to use that to connect to it so that we can have a really powerful LLM. But if you don't want to use OpenAI, you can use really any model that you want, and you'll see in Langflow that you can connect to a bunch of different ones. So let's go through the first step here, which is installing Langflow. To do that, we're going to copy this command from the documentation, which I'll link in the description, to install the pre-release of Langflow. So we'll go back to VS Code, we'll open up some kind of terminal, in this case, I've just created a new folder. This is where I'm going to have my PDF file. Now, we'll talk about the PDF in one second, but for now, let's paste this command in. And if you are on Mac or Linux, it's going to be pip three install Langflow dash dash pre dash dash force dash install. And if you're on Windows, it's just going to be pip. Okay, so we'll run that command. I've already got it installed. So I'm not going to do that. It will take a few minutes to run because there are quite a lot of packages that need to be installed. And then what we can do, is run the command in our terminal, which is Langflow run. When we do that, it should start Langflow on local host, and then give us a browser window where we can start creating our flows. All right, so after you wait a second, you should get some kind of output starting Langflow, whatever the version is, and then it will actually open it at this address. So I've got to open here in my browser, you're not going to see any flows because you haven't created any yet. But in my case, I've created a few. So they're here. So now what we can do is just press on new project here, and we can make a new flow. Now you can work off of a template, or you can just click blank flow, which is what we're going to do for now. Now the way these flows are actually stored is with JSON. So what you're able to do is import and export the flows with a simple JSON document. And I'll actually leave a link to a GitHub repository in the description that will have the JSON for the flow we're about to build, as well as the PDF document and any other information that you need, in case you just want to go right into the finished product and not actually build it out yourself. Anyways, we're now inside of a flow, and we can start building out our application. But I do want to mention that we do want to get access to some kind of PDF that we're going to be providing to the app. So in my case, I have this restaurant Q&A, I'll leave this in the GitHub repo in case you just want to download this one. But you can also make your own, or you could just get a PDF you already have, and you can feed that into the app. But just make sure you have\n",
